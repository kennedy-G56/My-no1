        <h1><u>WILL AI REPLACE HUMANS</u></h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>In todays fast growing world,<b>Artificial Inteligence (AI)</b>is every where-writing essays,making art,answering questions driving cars and a lot mare.Its quick,efficient and never tires.So it's natural to wonder,will AI replace humans?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Ai is good at petterns,speed and scale.It handles repetitive tasks,analyzes data and generates content,all without a meal.But there is a limit to what it can do.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>AI doesn't understand meaning the way we do.It can mimic empathy,but it doesn't feel.It can generate ideas, but it doesn't have real expirience.
            It doesn't know right or wrong,only what it was trained to pridict,that it can pridict.This matter in job requiring,judgment,ethics,creativity and emotional intelligence.</p>
            <p></p>
        <p>Yes some job will disapear,but more often,they will change.AI wont replace humans.It will rwplace the old working style in to new.The real winners will be those who know how to work with AI,not against it.</p>
